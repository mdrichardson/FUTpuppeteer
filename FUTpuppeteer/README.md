# FUTpuppeteer/FUTpuppeteer

This is where the core FUTpuppeteer files are stored. Read the comments in each file if you want more granular instructions for how to use it.

## core.py

Stores the `Session()` class and all functions that are meant to be called by the user.

## All other .py files

All other .py files in this directory are meant to be left alone. You can read them to get a better idea of how the bot works, but their functions are not meant to be called directly.

## Strategies

The .py files within the `strategies` directory are also not meant to be called. Each file contains the code used to run each different strategy. See the `README.md` within that folder for an explanation of strategies.

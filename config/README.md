## bot*.yml
You can have as many of these as you want, just make sure to name them `bot1.yml`, `bot2.yml`, etc. In your `Run.py` file, make sure `bot_number` matches the number in your `bot*.yml`. For example, `bot_numer=1` for `bot1.yml`.

Read the comments in botExample to see what each variable controls. If there isn't a comment, it's because it should be self-explanatory or is already commented in another section, above.

**Be sure to input your settings at the bottom**

## global.yml
